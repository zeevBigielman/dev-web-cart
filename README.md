# Shopping Cart Project

## Description

This project is a shopping cart application developed as part of the "Dev Web Skills Exam." The goal was to demonstrate my web development skills by integrating several key functionalities.

## Features

•⁠ ⁠Retrieve products from the open-source API: FakeStoreAPI

•⁠ ⁠Display products in a list with multiple rows

•⁠ ⁠Quantity selector to increase or decrease product quantity

•⁠ ⁠Button to remove a product from the cart

•⁠ ⁠Save modifications after page refresh

•⁠ ⁠Cart summary displayed on the left, including:

## Shipping cost

Total product price

Increase in shipping cost if more than 4 products are added to the cart

Technologies Used:

•⁠ ⁠HTML

•⁠ ⁠CSS

•⁠ ⁠JavaScript

•⁠ ⁠Bootstrap

## Project Management with Git

Although I could not create multiple commits for each feature, here is how I would have proceeded:

1.⁠ ⁠Created a remote repository with two branches: master and development

2.⁠ ⁠Developed features on the development branch

3.⁠ ⁠Created distinct commits for each feature:

4.⁠ ⁠Fetching products from the API

5.⁠ ⁠Displaying products on the page

6.⁠ ⁠Managing quantity and product removal

7.⁠ ⁠Updating the total price and shipping cost

8.⁠ ⁠Saving modifications after page refresh

9.⁠ ⁠Merged the development branch into master after validation

## Deployment

The project is deployed online on [github] (https://github.com/zeevBigielman/dev-web-cart.git).

## Local Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zeevBigielman/dev-web-cart.git

## Future Improvements
